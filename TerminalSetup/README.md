# Terminal Setup

A silly script to reinstall my settins for my terminal should I lose them. 
Make sure that [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) is installed first.
Just run 
```
./make_vim_pretty.sh
```
from the TerminalSetup directory and it'll install
[ultimate-vim](https://github.com/amix/vimrc), 
[oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), 
[iTerm colors](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes),
[vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) and
[ultisnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips). I should probably add
[powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline) to this and also
[fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts), but I like installing those
separately.
