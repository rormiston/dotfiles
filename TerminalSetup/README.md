# Terminal Setup

A silly script to reinstall my settins for my terminal should I lose them. 
Just run ./make_vim_pretty.sh and it'll install ultimate-vim, oh-my-zsh, 
iTerm colors, vimwiki and ultisnips. I should probably add fonts to this 
and also powerline (https://github.com/powerline/powerline), but I like
installing those separately.
